.TH pacsync  8 "November 25, 2010" "version 0.1" "PACSYNC MANUAL"
.SH NAME
pacsync -\ bring package database in sync with a configuration set
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pacsync
.SH DESCPRIPTION

Pacsync is a frontend for pacman which rather than taking commands such as
"install foo" or "remove bar" looks at a set of configuration files to
determine what should be on the system, then brings system in sync with that
view.

.SH CONFIGURATION

Configuration files for pacsync belong in the directory contained in
$PACSYNC_CONF, or /etc/pacsync if it is not defined. The configuration defines
sets of packages. Each set comes in the form of a pair of files, <setname>.set
and <setname>.mask, where <setname> is the name of the set. The .set file
contains a list of packages, groups, and other sets that should be included
in the file. The .mask file is of the same form, but specifies packages,
groups, and other sets that should be ommitted from the set, even if would
otherwise be included. The form of these files is a series of lines, each of
which names a package, set, or group. If the line begins with a '<', its
remainder specifies a set name, if it begins with a '@' its remainder
specifies a group name, and otherwise the line specifies a package.

The special set 'world' determines the set of packages that should be
explicitly installed on the system. When pacsync is run, it will ensure that
all packages in world are explicitly installed, no other packages are
installed explicitly, and only packages in world and their dependencies (both
direct and indirect) are installed.

.SH EXAMPLES

A set which contains all of the xorg group except for xf86-video-vesa and
xorg-twm, plus xf86-video-intel and xf86-input-synaptics:

.B x11.set:

.nf
@xorg 
xf86-video-intel
xf86-input-synaptics
.fi

.B x11.mask:

.nf
xf86-video-vesa
xorg-twm
.fi

A set which contains all of kde, except for the kdegames group:

.B kde.set:

.nf
@kde
.fi

.B kde.mask:

.nf
@kdegames
.fi

A possible world set for a kde desktop machine, given the two sets above:

.B world.set:

.nf
@base
@base-devel
<x11
<kde
.fi

(world.mask is empty)

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

PACSYNC_CONF - location in which to look for configuration sets.

PACSYNC_CACHE - location to use for caching purposes.
